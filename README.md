Q : How does the filtering work and what options do i have?  
A : You can filter key/values by typing a keyword in the input field.  
- Typing a keyword without "!" will return results that include that keyword. (e.g. keyword)  
- Typing a keyword with "!" will return results that exclude that keyword. (e.g. !keyword)
