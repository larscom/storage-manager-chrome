Faq
----------------------
Q : How does the filtering work and what options do i have?  
A : You can filter key/values by typing a keyword in the input field.  
- Typing a keyword without '!' will return results that include that keyword. (e.g. 'keyword')  
- Typing a keyword with '!' will return results that exclude that keyword. (e.g. '!keyword')  

Q : Why can't i remove certain cookies like '_ga'?  
A : Cookies like '_ga' are cookies that belong to google and will be created back instantly if removed..
