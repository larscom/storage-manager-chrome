Faq
----------------------
Q : How does the filtering work and what options do i have?  
A : You can filter key/values by typing a keyword in the input field.  
- Typing a keyword without '!' will return results that include that keyword. (e.g. 'keyword')  
- Typing a keyword with '!' will return results that exclude that keyword. (e.g. '!keyword')  

Q : Why can't i remove certain cookies like '_ga'?  
A : Cookies like '_ga' are cookies that belong to google and will be created back instantly if removed.. 

Q : Sometimes a red R appears in the icon, what is that?     
A : It means you have to reload the webpage. Or the webpage doesn't allow access to web storage (some google webpages do not allow access to localstorage etc)    

Q : I can only import cookies as session cookies why is that?  
A : When imported, the expire dates are unknown.
